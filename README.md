# correct-word
The correct-word project is an application that utilizes the pyspellchecker library to identify and correct spelling errors in a given text. The application loads a dictionary of words and then scans the text for misspelled words. Once identified, it suggests corrections and offers a list of candidate words for each spelling error.
